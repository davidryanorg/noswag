# The No SWAG Manifesto

## What is Swag?

We're not talking about pirate swag! The kind of swag that we're interested in is the free goods given away at events, such as technology conferences and events, for promotional/marketing purposes. Usually it's of low quality, and mass produced. The value of swag to the business is highly questionable. Some companies get a positive boost for memroable swag. But most of the times it's uninteresting, boring and basically wasteful.

## Why is Swag bad?

There's a number of reasons why Swag is "bad":

1. Most of it is thrown away.
2. It has very little value.
3. Usually doesn't have the desired impact (marketing).

## The war on Swag

We're fighting a war. A war on waste, and the impact that waste has on our climate and cultivating wasteful culture. Swag represents a small battle within this global war, but we believe that 

So kids, remember ...

**Just say NO to SWAG.**

## What can we do?

1. Cut down our creation of swag as vendors at events. If possible, aim for no swag.
2. Use the money saved for better causes. Contribute it back to the environment, or to help those in need. 
3. Don't take swag from vendors.

This is not a publicitly stunt. We've particpated in swag creation and swag consumption. But for the past few years we decided to use our swag budget to help causes, such as food banks, in events that we've sponsored.
